# 👋 Hey there, I'm Malini Janaki Sankaran!

🧠I'm a curious soul who loves solving problems, connecting the dots, and learning new things that make the world (and the web) a better place!

🛠️I enjoy building tech that's thoughtful, scalable, and rooted in real human impact.

🎓 Currently pursuing my Master’s in Information Systems at **Northeastern University**, Boston.  

💻 Passionate about **full-stack development**, **cloud computing**, and using technology to drive **meaningful change** — whether in sustainability, accessibility, or education.

🌍 I’m currently diving into the world of **AI** and **Cloud Computing**, while exploring opportunities that bridge technology with meaningful change.

☕ Fueled by curiosity and chai.

## ✨ About Me

 Exploring new ideas and learning keeps me energized. I also love getting lost in a good book, going on walks or hikes, dancing, and trying out new recipes in the kitchen. 

 I’m originally from 🌴 Kerala, India, and try to carry a bit of its calm, coastal spirit with me wherever I go!
